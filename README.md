Dear readers,

​         Here are the code and data set of Paper "Prediction of drug-disease associations based on ensemble meta paths and singular value decomposition".

​         If you use the data set, please kindly cite this paper:

```
@article{wu2019EMP-SVD,
  title={Prediction of drug-disease associations based on ensemble meta paths and singular value decomposition},
  author={Wu, Guangsheng and Liu, Juan and Yue, Xiang},
  journal={BMC bioinformatics},
  volume={20},
  number={3},
  pages={134},
  year={2019},
  publisher={BioMed Central}
}
```



To run the code, Python 3 or Anaconda 3 is needed.  The results depend on the random numbers generated by your computer to some extent, which may not be exactly the same as those shown in the paper, maybe slightly different.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact wgs@whu.edu.cn





Some typo in the paper:

The number of proteins in this data set is 1467, not 1147. I am sorry to have typed it wrong.

So, in page 3, section "Data sets",  1147 should be corrected to 1467.

In Table 1 (page 4 ),  due to the change of protein number, some of the statistic information of the data set should be changed, 1147 should be 1467, 0.0034 should be 0.0027,  0.0027 should be 0.0021.

The typo do not affect any experiment results in this paper.
